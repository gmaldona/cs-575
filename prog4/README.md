I have done this assignment completely on my own. I have not copied it, nor have
I given my solution to anyone else. I understand that if I am involved in
plagiarism or cheating, I will have to sign an official form that I have cheated
and that this form will be stored in my official university record. I also
understand that I will receive a grade of 0 for the involved assignment for my
first offense and that I will receive a grade of “F” for the course for any
additional offense.
